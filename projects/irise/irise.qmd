The aim of iRISE is to understand the drivers of irreproducibility, and present and test specific interventions to increase the quality, reliability and reusability of scientific evidence. I am co-leading work-package 1 which will condense the current understanding of different types of reproducibility and build on current knowledge to find the best metrics to quantify or measure those same types of reproducibility.
