I am interested in Meta-research, Reproducibility, Open Science, and in improving research evaluation.\n\n* I teach Good Research Practices to PhD Students and other postdocs at the UZH Graduate Campus.\n\n* Before join the CRS, I worked as a statistician in the Data Team of the [Swiss National Science Foundation](https://www.snf.ch/).\n\n* And before, in January 2019, that I defended my PhD in the [\"Epidemiology and Biostatistics\" Structured PhD Program](https://www.epibiostat-phd.uzh.ch/en.html). \n\n* I am also a board member of the [Swiss Statistical Society](https://stat.ch/en/) and a co-organizer of the [Zurich R User Group](https://www.meetup.com/zurich-r-user-group/).\n\n## What is Meta-Research? \n\nMeta-research has been defined as the interdisciplinary study of research itself ([link](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005468)). Sounds pretty meta, right? \n\n## What's wrong with research evaluation?\n\nWell, where should I start? In short, funding and hiring decisions in research are based on peer review. However, peer review has been shown to be inefficient, biased and unreliable. A good resource to start reading up on what's wrong with (grant) peer review is [Guthrie et al. (2018)](https://f1000research.com/articles/6-1335/v2). On top of that there is a misalignment between the evaluation criteria used by funding bodies, most often emphasising quantity of publications/citations over quality of research, and the desired outcome = good, transparent and reproducible research.
