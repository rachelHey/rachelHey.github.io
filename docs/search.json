    "text": "What’s wrong with research evaluation?\nWell, where should I start? In short, funding and hiring decisions in research are based on peer review. However, peer review has been shown to be inefficient, biased and unreliable. A good resource to start reading up on what’s wrong with (grant) peer review is Guthrie et al. (2018). On top of that there is a misalignment between the evaluation criteria used by funding bodies, which often emphasis quantity of publications/citations over quality of research, and the desired outcome which should be “good, transparent and reproducible research”. We therefore need alternative criteria for excellence that align with Good Research Practice and need to acknowledge the bias and uncertainty in peer review when making funding decisions."
